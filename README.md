## Quick Start

**Need to target the itch.io build of the game? Try the [Universal template](https://github.com/Zumbi-Blocks-2-Modding/ZumbiBlocks2.PluginTemplate.Universal)!**

This guide assumes you already have Zumbi Blocks 2 installed, complete with the BepInEx mod loader.  
If you have not yet installed BepInEx, follow the [official guide](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/user_guide/installation/index.html) and return when done.

1. [Create a new repository based on this template](https://github.com/Zumbi-Blocks-2-Modding/ZumbiBlocks2.PluginTemplate.Steam/generate).
2. Using your IDE, CLI, or Git-oriented desktop program, [clone your repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
3. Open your local repository with your IDE. If prompted to trust the project, accept.

You're now free to customize the project!  
The Steam template takes care of all references for you, so you can focus on what really matters.

1. Open the project settings and rename `ExamplePlugin` to your new mod's name.
2. Fill out the plugin fields with your own details.
3. Change the log message to one of your own.
4. [Add a license](https://choosealicense.com/)! This is very important in the open source community.

When done customizing your plugin base, click on Build.  
Your plugin will automatically be installed. Open the game and test it out!
